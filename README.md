# BackRoute
Welcome to the BackRoute project! BackRoute is a lightweight and reliable solution to create a tunnel between two servers with `IPv4` and `IPv6`, using `GRE`, `IPIP`, or `SIT`. This project is designed to build a secure and stable connection between servers across different networks, bypass restrictions, and keep your data transfer fast and steady. In this README, you’ll find step-by-step instructions for installing, configuring, and running BackRoute, including details on tunnel modes and how to run the tunnel continuously as a `service` without interruptions.
