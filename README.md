# BackRoute
Welcome to the `BackRoute` project! BackRoute is a lightweight and reliable solution to create a tunnel between two servers with `IPv4` and `IPv6`, using `GRE`, `IPIP`, or `SIT`. This project is designed to build a secure and stable connection between servers across different networks, bypass restrictions, and keep your data transfer fast and steady. In this README, you’ll find step-by-step instructions for installing, configuring, and running BackRoute, including details on tunnel modes and how to run the tunnel continuously as a `service` without interruptions.
## Introduction
BackRoute creates a Layer 3 network tunnel that can establish a connection between a client server and a remote server using different modes with local IPs. By default, this tunnel doesn’t support Port Forwarding and simply provides a secure path for data transfer between the IPs. But this is where your creativity comes in !! you can combine BackRoute with advanced tunneling tools and Port Forward setups to build a flexible and powerful system that goes beyond the limitations of a simple Layer 3 tunnel. Sometimes, combining BackRoute with tools that seem broken can work like a charm.

Of course, it’s worth noting that all these capabilities only hold if your local IPs on the servers aren’t blocked by ISPs, network routers, or filtering systems.
